# Astrophysics Presentations

This repository contains selected academic presentations prepared during my studies
in astrophysics at the University of Vienna.

The talks focus on cosmological simulations, large-scale structure, galaxy formation,
and reionization, and were presented in the context of coursework and research seminars.
